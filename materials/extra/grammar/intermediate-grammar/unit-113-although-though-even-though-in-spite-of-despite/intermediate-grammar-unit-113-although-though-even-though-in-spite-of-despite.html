                    <p>Last year Paul and Sarah had a holiday by the sea.
                        It rained a lot, but they enjoyed it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You can say:</p>
                    <p><b>Although</b> it rained a lot, they enjoyed it. <span class="color-lightgrey">Apesar de ter chovido
                            muito, eles gostaram.</span></p>
                    <p>or</p>
                    <p><b>In spite of</b> / <b>Despite the rain</b>, they enjoyed it. <span class="color-lightgrey">Apesar
                            da chuva, eles gostaram.</span></p>
                </div>

        <section>

                <p class="color-white">B</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>After <b>although</b> we use a subject + verb:</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• Although</b> it rained a lot, we enjoyed our holiday.</p>
            <p><b>•</b> I didn't get the job <b>although</b> I had the necessary qualifications.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Compare the meaning of although and because.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>•</b> We went out <b>although</b> it was raining heavily.</p>
            <p><b>•</b> We didn't go out <b>because</b> it was raining heavily.</p>
        </section>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>After <b>in spite</b> of or <b>despite</b>, we use a noun, a pronoun (<b>this</b>/<b>that</b>/<b>what</b> etc.) or -ing</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• In spite of the rain</b>, we enjoyed our holiday.</p>
            <p><b>•</b> I didn't get the job <b>in spite of having</b> the necessary qualifications.</p>
            <p><b>•</b> She wasn't well, but in <b>spite of this</b> she continued working.</p>
            <p><b>• In spite of what</b> I said yesterday, I still love you.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Despite</b> is the same as <b>in spite of</b>. We say <b>in spite of</b>, but <b>despite</b> (without of):</p>
            <p><b>•</b> She wasn't well, but despite this she continued working. (not despite of this)</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can say in spite of the fact (that)... and despite the fact (that)… :</p>
            <p><b>•</b> I didn't get the job <b>in spite of the fact</b> (<b>that</b>) / <b>despite the fact</b> (<b>that</b>) I had the necessary qualifications.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Compare <b>in spite of</b> and <b>because</b> of:</p>
            <p><b>•</b> We went out <b>in spite of the rain</b>. (or… <b>despite the rain</b>.)</p>
            <p><b>•</b> We didn't go out <b>because</b> of the rain</p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Compare <b>although</b> and <b>in spite of</b> / <b>despite</b>:</p>
            <p><b>•</b> <b>Although the traffic was bad</b>, we arrived on time.</P>
            <p><b>•</b> <b>In spite of the traffic</b>, we arrived on time. (not in spite of the traffic was bad)</p>
            <p><b>•</b> I couldn't sleep <b>although I was</b> very tired.</p>
            <p><b>•</b> I couldn't sleep <b>despite of being</b> very tired. (not despite I was
                tired.)</p>

                <p class="color-white">E</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p><b>Though</b> is the same as <b>although</b>:</p>
            <p><b>•</b> I didn't get the job though I had the necessary qualifications.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In spoken English, we often use <b>though</b> at the end of a sentence.</p>
            <p><b>•</b> The house isn't so nice. I like the garden though. (=but I like the garden)</p>
            <p><b>•</b> I see them every day. I've never spoken to them though. (=but I've never spoken to them)</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Even though</b> (but not 'even' alone) is a stronger form of <b>although</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Even though</b> I was really tired, I couldn't sleep.
            <br>
            (<i>not</i> Even I was really tired… )</p>
