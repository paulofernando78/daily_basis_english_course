                The time is one o'clock in the morning. The place is the Ritesville town art gallery. A window opens
                and a man comes in. His name is Harry Black, and he is a thief. It is dark in the art gallery, but Harry
                has a light. He looks across the room at a painting. "There it is!" he says.

                Harry moves quickly across the room. He stands and
                looks at the painting. "A million dollars for this?" he thinks. "I don't understand it." But he takes a
                knife from his coat. Then he takes the painting very, very slowly from its frame.

                Harry goes back across the room to the window, but he
                walks into a table. There is a beautiful blue glass vase on the table. It falls on the floor and breaks
                into a hundred pieces. Harry smiles. "Is that a million-dollar vase?" he thinks. "It isn't now!" He runs
                across the pieces of glass to the window.</p>

                Harry has a room in Mrs. Allen's rooming house. He
                goes quietly up to his room and closes the door. Mrs. Allen and her daughter, Janey, are sleeping. They
                don't hear him. In his room, Harry takes the painting from his bag. He puts it in a newspaper, then he
                puts the newspaper under his bed.</p>

                In the morning, Janey Allen is in the kitchen. She is
                putting old bottles into a box. "Recycling is important," Janey thinks. On the TV, a reporter is at the
                Ritesville art gallery. He is talking about the painting. "It's a million-dollar painting," he is
                saying. "Here's a photo of it."</p>

                mother, "Do you have any old bottles?" "No," Mrs. Allen says. "That's all, Janey. But the newspaper
                recycling truck is coming today." "Of course!" Janey says. "It's Friday!"</p>

                dollars?" Harry says. "No! It's a million-dollar painting! ... What? ... No, I want fifty thousand, not
                five! ... What? ... The painting? Yes, I have it, and it's OK."</p>

                morning, she takes them from every room in the house. Then later, the newspaper recycling truck arrives.
                Janey opens Harry's door and looks into his room. She always takes his old newspapers or bottles for
                recycling. "Ah!" she thinks. "There's a newspaper under Harry's bed."</p>

                of the men. Harry is coming back to the house. He sees the recycling truck, and he sees Janey. "It's
                Friday!" he says. "The newspaper—! Oh, no!"</p>

                "Why is your newspaper important, Harry?" she asks. "It's two days old." But Harry doesn't hear her. He
                is thinking, "My million-dollar painting! Where is it?" The men from the recycling truck are watching
                Harry, too. But now Janey is looking at Harry's shoe.</p>
