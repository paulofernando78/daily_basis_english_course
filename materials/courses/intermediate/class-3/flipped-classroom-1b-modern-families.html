                <p><b>Future plans and intentions </b>(<i>be going</i> to + base form)</p>
                <br>
                <p>We use be <i>going to</i> when we have <span class="color-red"><b>already decided</b></span> to do
                    something.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Examples</p>
                <p>My sister's gonna adopt a child.</p>
                <p>Are you gonna buy a new car or a used one?</p>
                <p>I'm not gonna go to New York City tomorrow. The meeting is canceled.</p>

                <p><b>Predictions</b> (<i>be going</i> to + base form)</p>
                <br>
                <p>We also use be <i>going to</i> to make a prediction about the future, especially when we have some <mark>evidence</mark>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Examples</p>
                <p>The Yankees are gonna win. They're <mark>playing really well.</mark></p>
                <p>Look at those <mark>black clouds</mark>. I think it's gonna rain.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When something is about to happen.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Example</p>
                <p>Get back! The bomb is gonna explode. (The bomb is ticking)</p>

                <p><b>Future arrangements</b> (present continuous: <i>be</i> + verb + -<i>ing</i>)</p>
                <br>
                <p>We often use the present continuous for future arrangements. There is a very little difference between the present continuous and <i>be going to</i> for future plans / arrangements, and often you can use either.</p>
                <br>
                <p>• <i>be going</i> to shows that you have made a decision.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Example</p>
                <p><i>We're going to get married next year.</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>• the present continous emphasizes that you have made the arrangements.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Example</p>
                <p>We're getting married on October 12th (twelfth).</p>
                <p>* We've already ordered the invitations, etc.</p>
                <p><span class="color-lightgray">Já encomendamos os convites, etc.</span></p>
                <br>
                <p>More examples</p>
                <p>Lorna and James are getting married in October.</p>
                <p>We're meeting at 10:00 tomorrow in Jack's office.</p>
                <p>Jane's leaving on Friday and coming back next Tuesday.</p>
