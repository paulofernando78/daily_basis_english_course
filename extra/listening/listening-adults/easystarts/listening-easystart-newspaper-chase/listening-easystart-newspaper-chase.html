His name is Harry Black, and he is a thief. It is dark in the art gallery, but Harry has a light. He looks across the room at a painting. "There it is!" he says.</p>

"I don't understand it." But he takes a knife from his coat. Then he takes the painting very, very slowly from its frame.</p>

It falls on the floor and breaks into a hundred pieces. Harry smiles. "Is that a million-dollar vase?" he thinks. "It isn't now!" He runs across the pieces of glass to the window.</p>

"There's a newspaper under Harry's bed."</p>
