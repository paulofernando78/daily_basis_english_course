      </p>
      <p><b>B:</b> Sorry, Grandma. What did you say?</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> I said, are you going to go to college next year?</p>
      <p><b>B:</b> No, Grandma. I've told you like 100 times. I'm not going to go to college. I'm going to look for a
        job. I need to ear some money.</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> All right, dear. You don't have to shout. I can hear you perfectly well, thank you. What time is it?
      </p>
      <p><b>B:</b> Ten to three. I'll get you some coffee.</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> Oh, thank you. That'd be nice.</p>

      <p><b>A:</b> Bye. See you tomorrow.</p>
      <p><b>B:</b> Bye. Hey, what do you tomorrow? Aren't you coming back tonight?</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> No, I told you about it yesyerday. I'm going to a party at Katie's. I'm staying overnight there.</p>
      <p><b>B:</b> Who else is going?</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> Oh, just the usual crowd. You don't know any of them.</p>
      <p><b>B:</b> Well, make sure you don't go to bed too late. And don't forget to...</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> Bye</p>
      <p><b>B:</b> Where's your coat? You can't go out like that. It's going to be cold tonight!</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> Bye!</p>

      <p><b>A:</b> Can I use your car tonight? </p>
      <p><b>B:</b> No, you can't.</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> You said you didn't need it. Why can't I borrow it?</p>
      <p><b>B:</b> Because you won't take care of it. You'll drive too fast.</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> I won't, I promise, I'll drive really slowly. I'll be really careful.</p>
      <p><b>B:</b> Oh, all right.</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> Thanks. See you</p>
